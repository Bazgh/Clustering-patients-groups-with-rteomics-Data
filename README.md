# Clustering-patients-groups-with-proteomics-Data
Omics Project- Fall 2024- University of Bern

Project Description: 
This Project aimed at grouping patients with Bladder Cancer, which is key in development of personalized treatment.
The dataset used for this objective was a Table of MetaData and Proteomics Data for 140 patients, The former is consist of the Phenotypic and clinical observations of patients, while the Latter includes the level of 3121 different proteins within the patients.
We used an Unsupervised Method- K-Means and were able to find 8 different subpoulations within the patients. Below is the scatter plot of our clusters.

The Next step of our project was to Find the most important features in grouping the patients. Our pipline for this objective was Decision Tree which provides intrepretable results. Below is the Bar chart showing the 7 dominant Proteins grouping the data.

The identified features, particularly the dominant proteins **CCNE1**, **S100A9**, **CTNNB1**, **UPK3A**, **NRP1**, **CXCR4**, and **GADD45A**, provide actionable insights for drug discovery, patient stratification, and personalized medicine.
